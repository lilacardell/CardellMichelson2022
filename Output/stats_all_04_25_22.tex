\begin{tablenotes}
\item [1] \footnotesize Monthly maize price data for retail markets from the WFP Global Food Prices Database for 2000-2021. Prices were adjusted to 2015 local currency value using FAO/IMF data on historical monthly CPI. National and subnational agricultural season data was reported from FAO-GIEWS via the University of Wisconsin. 
\item [2] \footnotesize A market was included if there was price data for at least one market-year as defined as having a harvest price and lean season price available for that market year. A country was included if there was at least one market in the country. 
\item [3] \footnotesize The totals in this table are smaller than the totals in Tables \ref{tab:retail_1}, \ref{tab:retail_2}, \ref{tab:wholesale_1}, \ref{tab:wholesale_2} as a unique market may sell more than one type of maize, e.g. in Cameroon there is overlap between the markets that sell white and yellow maize .
